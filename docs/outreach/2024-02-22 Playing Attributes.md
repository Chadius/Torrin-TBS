# Tolerance for Learning New Rules
## Neutral
_Players in this group are fine with learning new rules if it is for the specific purpose of playing a new game._

Jo plays board games and a few video games. She wants to have a good time and isn't interested in learning all ins and outs of the game, just enough to get going.

## Accepting
_Players in this group like learning new games and new rules._

Max will look for ways to exploit the rules. He's the type to get into character tier arguments, or build guides.
He tends to pick a few games and stick to them.

This group is over-saturated and over-represented in the industry.

# Challenge Level
1 failure per 1 success

On a default difficulty, I expect players to restart each mission once.

I encourage people to play multiple times over mastering the game.

# Desired Time Investment
## Session Time
15 minutes to 1 hour per mission

- Time includes setup and post mission report.
- Initial and final missions can be shorter as they capstone the campaign.
- Army setup and design may be its own session.

Otherwise, I want to be able to save mid mission, but I want to avoid a marathon session.

This is how long they should play for a satisfying session. 

## Total time
_10 hours to complete the campaign._

I expect around 10 missions to complete a campaign. Short for the Tactical RPG genre.

10 hours is my skill limit in terms of making a game anyway.

Jo will play the game once to experience the story, and may go in a second time to view different optional conversations.

Max is the type who will tolerate the story the first time, but then skip to get to the next mission. Max will try multiple combinations to see the best way to play.

# Pace Preference
_Tactical Role Play Game: Slow, turn based, thoughtful pace._

I imagine setting up the team and their abilities to be thought out and carefully prescribed as the player thinks through their actions.

Combat itself should be slow and thoughtful, but simple enough to not drown in too many options. The player should spend their time planning their action and watching it play out.

# Competitiveness
_Mildly Competitive_

Max will show off his army build and post his total turn count. He may host a video ranking the squaddies in terms of overall utility.

Jo may stream the game to show off the conversations, or just vibe with her crew.

Players will evaluate their campaign progress and optimization techniques. Fire Emblem is rife with this. Or people may just show off characters, as Fire Emblem has.

# Platform
_Web Browser, tablet or larger_

Due to my limited skill, we'll stick to a web browser for now. We should expect a tablet-sized or larger interface.

It runs on a fixed 1280x720 resolution - we'll need different resolutions later. 

# Skills Required
- Battlefield analysis. Like chess, you need to be comfortable knowing where to move the pieces, and what options you have.
- Probability. Looking at your buffs and debuffs to figure out the chance you'll hit.

# Genre/art/setting/narrative
- Arabian Knights
- Warfare and city defense
- Duty, revenge, a second chance
- Teenage content

# Value gained from the player
## Payment
_One-Time Purchase_

This will be free or low cost. I'm doing it for exposure (hehe)

 Maybe Expansion Purchases in the future.

## Word of mouth
The only way to advance and get more users is if they like it.

# Target Audience Value
I have a small budget.

I just need people to notice.

Just... one random review would be enough.
