Guide Torrin and Sir Camil as they clear out a temple courtyard of demonic invaders. This is a Turn Based Strategy game, so placement and movement are key.

You can reply here or send feedback to chadserrant@chadius.com . I'd love to hear your ideas for improvement (or the bug you found.) Thanks for trying out my game.
