# Summary

- 3 cards taken
  - How do I work on a social media presence?

Raw footage is already on pCloud storage.

## Need to focus on UI
### People have different ways to move
Some people thought they could break up turns/they only get one action per turn
- Click on Sir Camil to move then click on Torrin, confused why they can't move her
- Click on Sir Camil to move, then click on the enemy, confused as to why they can't control them
- Tutorial has too many words? May need to control the text box sizes.
- Many didn't read the instructions.
- Tutorial pictures have too many arrows!

## Stuff I thought about
- It's not clear how to attack. I had to coach many players.
- Potential audience: board game experience
- Practice your spiel to sell the game: It's a TBS. It's on itch. Over a year. WIP!
- Needs a compelling cover, more descriptive. 2003 Fire Emblem showed weapons
- There was a bug at 8:14. I think they selected Petra and then ended her turn, making the game look for her icon. Review the tapes to confirm.
- Need to show you can't split turns
- It's not clear what the sand tiles are - I need textures
- The tutorial doesn't mention WHERE the sand is

### Done
#### Check right now against main
##### Canceling range doesn't highlight tiles
- Canceling range doesn't highlight tiles - This is not fixed in main.
- Moved through enemies (I think this is a bug)
##### Moved through enemies
This is a known bug, but I have more info:
- The movement is going right through the enemy, I'm not paying action points to move around the foe.
#### Make new stories out of this
- Make "Start new game button" more prominent than "Continue" - some players clicked on that instead
- Only show the HUD when you can control the character/turn is midway
- Don't change the HUD focus once a character is acting
- Give smaller summary on hover over
- Actions should show how many actions and maybe its range
- Action bar is color coded the same as the HP.
- A new cover image
- It's not clear what the sand tiles are - I need textures
- The tutorial doesn't mention WHERE the sand is
- Right mouse click to cancel
- More context on abilities - cost, range, damage
#### Research
- Research "Armello" by League of Geeks

Movie 1   (29:42 - 40:50) 11:08
I spoke to this person for a while, they are just getting into game development. Professional programmer. Talked to him a lot about refactoring and tests.

Has board game experience, could connect to this audience 

- Reminds of Cattan tiles
- Understands it's difficult to teach people how to play
- board game experience, mentioned how hard it is to learn

(Me: practice your spiel. It's a TBS. It's on itch. Over a year. WIP)
(Me: continue!)

## 8:04
Real Time ( 8:03:45 - ::)
Movie 1   ( 50:34 - : ) END

This woman played the game the most and gave lots of feedback.

- Actually Read instructions!
- Next button!
- Not clear turn is over...
- Clicking on attack icon
- Likes seeing Enemies move (offscreen scroll!)
- Coached how to attack once, then she got it.
- (Also lucky crits! Sadly critical misses!)
- Show how many action points an action will take.
- Clicking on a squaddie seems confusing.
- Clicking on Next broke it at 8:14

## 20:13
didn't play, not a TBS player


## 8:16
(20:16 Me thinks: Needs a compelling cover, more descriptive. 2003 Fire Emblem showed weapons)

## 20:23
Real Time ( 8:23:13 - 8:29:18)
Movie 2   ( 7:38 - 13:45 ) 6:07

Casual player, plays strategy games

- Asked about the story
- Too many arrows in tutorial?
- Read instructions
- Tries to click on enemy...
- Out of range for water cannon.
- Tried to end Petra's turn, ended Torrin's instead
- "Is the green stuff sand?" 2nd person to ask
- Tries to move Torrin around when it isn't her turn
- (Me thinks: Need to show you can't split turns)
- Love the strategy
- Armello by League of Geeks - similar?

## 8:34 
Asked about social media... how to follow? Had to convince of itch.io (took a card, 3 cards total)

## 20:41
Real Time ( 8:41:32 - 8:48:46)
Movie 2   ( 25:58 - 37:12 ) 7:34

It's Chris, host of Boston Indies! Obviously has experience as a gamer, and as a Game dev.

- Canceling range doesn't highlight tiles - I think I fixed this in dev.
- (Me thinks: the tutorial doesn't mention WHERE the sand is)
- Combat log to keep track of enemy turn
- Needs more context on abilities - cost, range, damage!
- Quick action bar is the same color as health
- R click should be cancel?
- Clicks again to move
- Moved through enemies (I think this is a bug)
- "All of the basics are there, you just need content and polish"
- Sir Camil can only attack, MAP is annoying (good!)
