# Summary
- This was good... for a first try/beginning project. Doubtful they know this is almost 18 months old.
- UI is still a mess, but some players pulled through and finished.
- The UI is good enough though for some players to grok for underlying mechanics, so they want more help there.
- Some users scroll the window to go up/down
- This one big mission is too big, hard to get difficulty right.
  - Moving isn't obvious, feels like a movement tutorial would do wonders.
  - But it may be a chore to hunt the remaining demons down.
- "Click on the target" looks like a button.
- Players did discover clicking to skip animations
- Locust range is not obvious. Used to water cannon's 1-2 range so they didn't expect 3 range attacks.

## Potential games to research
- Settlers of Catan: The hex tiles have red outlines and multiple art types to indicate terrain.
- Baldur's Gate 3: Turn Based Combat touches that I may just be missing.

## Setup
Glad I had an extension cable.
Don't use the 2016 computer, the frame rate drops.
Needs a connection of some kind to the server to load files.

- Local copy crashed when it tried to get data. Not sure what happened there.
- itch.io works IF there is an internet connection.
- Loading bugs still happening - I thought I fixed that in 0.0.023? I'll have to mess with the internet speed in my browser.

"Feels like a good first pass"

- Player says he likes TBS
- Moved Sir Camil down to get cover
- Got stuck moving Torrin & Sir Camil into each other.
- A movement tutorial may be useful.
- "Click on the target" has same intensity as "OK" button
- Preview highlighted tiles are bright and getting mixed with giving commands 
- Clicked on Move button to toggle/untoggle UI
- Accidental Movement Clicks
- Cancel button is obvious

Probably the most engaging user, comfortable enough to play. Very emotional.

- Wound up selecting "End Turn" because of confusion over the "Out of Range"
- Asked if I drew the art and sprites. "I like them, they're funny."
- Click to move confusion?
- Discovered click to skip animation.
- Range Highlights is confusing.
- A Move Misclick cost Sir Camil his turn.
- He did ask if the PCs were immortal, as enemies kept missing.
- He didn't notice Sir Camil was low on HP, and only picked up on it when Sir Camil was killed.
- Which was right after he asked if he was immortal. He did note the irony.
- Likes the Hexagonal Map.

# 7:33 Miss
Woman walked by, took a look, read the screen... and kept moving.
She was forced to read the screen to figure out what was going on.
It should have been clear at a glance.

# 7:36 - 8:01
Me: It's a Turn Based Strategy game.
User: Hell Yeah.

This person was familiar with UI and TBS and we wound up talking a lot about the game.
He said that if I wasn't here to explain things, he would feel completely lost.

- Confused by tutorial. "Can I spend 3 Actions Points for all Heroes, or 3 per Hero?"
- Didn't realize the sand slowed him down.
- Mentioned that 2 & 3 boot icons are too similar.
- He mentioned the powers are inconsistent - he eventually realized defaults aren't shown.
  - Didn't know range on attacks
  - Didn't know which cost more than 1 action
  - How long do buffs last?
- There's no way for him to understand statuses. He asked if there was a way to learn more and there isn't, currently.
  - Hustle & Elusive
  - Absorb & Armor - They seemed to understand it vaguely, but they weren't sure how long it would last
- "click on the target" should give more feedback, like if the target is out of range or invalid

- % chances don't add up to 100. Confusing.
  - Didn't know there were 4 degrees of success
  - Didn't know there are 2d6 rolls (more reason why I need to animate it)
  - Said a die rolling animation would make it more clear.
  - Realized it's out of 36, so a % isn't accurate
  - When I mentioned the space constraint, he suggested a bar highlighting the chances 

- Confused about MAP message - where was this indicated? 
  - Didn't notice buffs & debuffs until 7:50 when they noticed MAP

- Using Torrent Surge feels like a meaningless chore
  - 0 cost so it may as well be used every turn

- Found click to skip

- There's a lot of mechanics that aren't obvious
- Wouldn't have noticed
- Action selection UI is obstructive - either put it above the squaddie or fix it to the bottom of the screen.

- Attack range on Locust is not obvious.

# 8:02 - 8:12
Definitely the harshest review, but this was someone who developed games and played TBS games professionally.
They stopped playing at 8:07 just to give me a critique - 5 minutes was all they needed.

- Why is the OK button on the bottom? It should be near the mouse.
- "OK should be in a popup"
- When the text mentioned moving the camera, they tried to move the camera. You can't move the camera in a conversation, so the player found it broken.
- "I'll have multiple turns of just moving forward with nothing happening" - considers this too easy
- "Seems basic for such a large map. I would expect more."
- Doesn't know how many actions remain. Using their game sense, they suspect it's in the lower left corner, but they aren't drawn to it so they don't care.
- Highlighted tiles on hover confused movement.
Stopped playing

- Rough Terrain was not clear
  - Expected Green grass for unobstructive terrain
  - Expected a Red border to indicate difficult movement
  - Black tiles were not clearly walls, pointed out Catan mountains as obviously blocking

He did ask about my inspiration and goals, so I know he's doing this out of respect and care.

Enemy AI was intriguing (my tip off this player makes games)
- Asking the AI for everything within 4 connections to devise the perfect plan is how you can make engaging enemies
- But they shouldn't be perfect, and should have limited knowledge
- The player should be able to exploit knowledge the AI doesn't know about.
  - Player Lying in wait for an ambush - the enemy shouldn't know the player is hiding there
  - Gold, maybe the player gets an influx the AI doesn't know about

He considers it is clearly not ready.

# 8:14 - 8:23
This person played Baldur's Gate 3 recently. There it is again.
"UI feels janky"

- Preview hover is confusing.
- "Does clicking the action and confirming it cost 2 actions?"
- Slither Demon #2 moved into the same spot as #1 and the player didn't notice (their friend may have distracted them)
- "Does Raise Shield require clicking on an enemy?"
- "Why am I prompted to Click on the Target when there is only 1 target?"
- Player did move the camera after the conversation prompted her to do it.
- Baldur's Gate picks the next character when the current character ends their turn, less time is wasted.
- "Why did squaddies turn gray when their turn ended?"

# 8:26 - 8:34
Didn't wait for me to guide them, just sat down and played.

- "Out of Range" makes no sense, again.
- Hover issues made movement confusing.
- Used Healing Touch! The only person to actually use it!
- Clicked the Move button to hide the interface!
- A 0 move action happened when they clicked the squaddie
- Also clicked skip turn
- At 8:34, surprised/upset that the attack missed

- Told me that it wasn't clear how to aggro the monsters.
- There's nothing to really cheese.
- Did not know how long Raise Shield lasted.

- Has a friend by the name of Torrin.
  ( Turns out Torrin is an Irish man's name, meaning Chief. OOPS)
