# Part 3

Nahla isn't strong enough to bless the entire riverbed. Aezma teaches her the ritual and offers to help. Her homeland was always rumored to be weak and vulnerable to demons. Rumors follow of those cursed or even born with demon blood. But Aezma has fought hard to maintain her reputation adn climb the ranks to High Priestess.  

As Nahla and Sir Camil reach the river point they make a terrible discovery. The demon has control over Aezma. Making good on their promise, the demon gloats over their latest victim. Either the demon kills them with Aezma's power, or they destroy the only person powerful enough to end the war. Sir Camil puts his confidence in his deity, and hopes to grant Aezma her rest.

 They are victorious, but Aezma is slain. Nahla tries but she lacks the power. The hordes are closing in. Sir Camil hears a voice, calling to him. Tempting him. Nahla feels the voice and panics, holding Sir Camil and entering his mind.

 Sir Camil feels lost within his mind, only to see a familiar face. Nahla guarding his sanity. And Aezma's spirit locking the demon down, not letting them escape. 

Nahla recognized the demon's manipulation powers. Their possesion reminded her of her own magical abilities, and Sir Camil had no resistance. But together, they slay the demon. Their death cries mock them for failing the ritual. 

Aezma's time is short. The heavens are calling to her. But there is still time to complete the ritual. Nahla knows it is her duty, and knows Aezma is holding on with the remains of her strength. Nahla draws upon unknown strength to complete the ritual, banishing the demon and reviving Sir Camil. The river swells with holy energy, whipping the horde to ash. The reserve army charges forth.
