# Overview
Sir Camil's cousin Varney finally catches up to him and confirms Torrin is with him. He is concerned about the demon presence, and thinks he has found a source, near the trash pit.

He lets them enter the pit first and draws his blade just as Petra interrupts. She outs Varney as a demon collaborator.
With his immediate plan dashed, he seals the door shut and lets the demons in the dark pit handle things.

Petra notes an exit on the other side of the map they can use to escape. She warns them it is pitch black and they can be ambushed in the darkness.

# Aftermath
With the team safe from the ambush, Petra finishes giving her report.

She tracked the demons down to a summoning circle, not far from Varney's room. He finished giving them orders and preparing himself. Her first instinct was to report her findings but Varney moved quickly.

He talks too much and announced his plan to find Torrin, as her plan had merit and upset his superiors. He planned his ambush in the trash pit, so Petra quickly made her way there to intercept him.
