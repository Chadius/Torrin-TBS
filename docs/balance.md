# Efficient Actions
In Pathfinder Second Edition, balance for individual players tends to come from making your actions more efficient.
- Ways to combine actions, like moving and attacking at the same time.
- Reducing Multiple Attack Penalty for multiple actions.
- Spending your final action to place a significant debuff so enemies are weaker for your teammates.
- Using magic to deny actions from enemies

A few examples:
- Flurry Rangers are infamous for getting multiple attacks with small MAP penalties.
- Monks use Flurry of Blows to attack twice for one action, so they can use actions to setup and debuff.
- Sorcerers can use Bon Mot to weaken someone's Will Saves before casting magic.
- Magic Weapon is an early game spell that adds an extra damage die to attacks.

The trick is to give players ways to make their turns more efficient.

Fire Emblem has a few examples:
- Fire Emblem games that throw a lot of weak enemies are labeled as Enemy Phase heavy, where you rely on counterattacks against your well-defended frontliners.
- Player Phase focused Fire Emblems rely on quick, strong units to break enemy ranks before they can overwhelm the Lord. FE4 is dubbed "Horse Emblem" due to large maps where mounted units shine.

# Horizontal Customization
Players should be able to easily choose their extra options.

These extra options should not be able to exceed mathematical boundaries.
- No attack bonuses, because then they are optional traps.

# Vertical Fixed growth
Direct power comes from level ups.
- Attack bonuses should apply to all attacks.
- Major attack bonuses (say +2 to attacks vs Armor) can be an award for reaching a high enough level.
- Access to higher tier abilities can be unlocked by level. Most of these are not more powerful but have more abilities.
- Better skill checks.
