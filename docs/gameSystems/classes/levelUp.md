## Level Up rewards
To help give the overall class feel, some combinations can offer 1 or 2 bonuses based on how many total levels the squaddie has.

Every few total levels, the squaddie can choose from a pool of abilities.

For example, a fighter may give +1 attacks vs Armor, +1 Body, +1 Max HP. These options are added to the level up pool.
