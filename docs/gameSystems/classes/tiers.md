# Tiers of Power

Representing an amount of effort taken, this denotes a power scale.

# Each Tier earns a +1 to all abilities
This will allow me to make low and high level enemies quickly, and provide a "Temporary Tier" buff/debuff.

# Each Tier gives a General Buff
- Extra HP
- Extra Movement (need to put a cap on this)
- Aid bonus

This is my concept of "general feats".

# A Tier may give access to more Tiers
A Squaddie must be Tier 2 before getting a new class.

For example, Teros begins as a Wizard. He must complete the Basic Wizard branch.

Now he's Tier 2. He chooses his Tier bonus.
At Tier 2, he automatically gains access to the Advanced Wizard branch.
He can also select the
- Warrior apprentice branch
- Inquisitor apprentice branch

And draw abilities from there.

## Benefit: Naturally enforces Subclassing
Pathfinder 2e found a good way to allow character variety without multiclassing: add feat trees that give some but not all powers from the base class.

Multiclassing has its own traps:
- Min-maxers would level dip and get abilities from front loaded classes, making some kind of abomination of a character career.
- Newcomers would be overwhelmed by decision and now know how to play their character.
- If abilities are spread too thin, the early game is too boring and most players will start later.

The Pathfinder Archetypes represent feat trees.
- They all have an introductory feat that gives some basic abilities.
- They are modeled after the most important aspect basic ability of a class. 
  - A Fighter Dedication gives martial weapon proficiency, for example. 
  - Wizard Dedication gives access to a spellbook and a pair of introductory spells.
- The tree will never give the complete set; there is always something only the original class can do.
  - A Fighter will always have the best weapon proficiency. A Fighter Dedication will always be at least 2 points behind.
  - A Wizard can cast more spells at a higher rank than anyone with a Wizard Dedication.

Once you take the Dedication feat, you cannot take another Feat Tree until you take at least 2 more feats from this tree.
- This prevents you from dipping into multiple classes and creating the Frankenstein character.
- This is a heavy cost if you plan to take another Dedication, as it means you have to take at least 2 more.
- Your base class's feats get more and more powerful, especially once you are past the basic tier. 

# Ramifications
## Most playable characters should be near Tier 2
Lini is a Cleric first, a Spy second. To represent her faith and her agility, she needs both. I've struggled with how to standardize this. At Tier 2, Lini has the basics of Cleric magic down, and has selected Spy as her following tier.

The Godsfont Guard represent an elite fighting force, so they should have lots of fighting experience. They are strong enough to deal with minor scuffles.

Torrin is a centuries-old warrior.
Blued is an experiment mostly gone right.

## Fewer trees taken as you level up
The cost of denying those class feats are too juicy.

## New feat trees can be added
They don't have to be class based!
- Maybe you make one about a ranged attack, like an archer.
- Maybe one focused on movement bonuses.
- Healing and Restoration?
