# Quickened
With extreme agility, you can act again.

## Mechanics
At the start of the turn, Quickened characters get a Bonus Action.
This Bonus Action is enough for a single 1 action activity.
The Bonus Action cannot be combined with the normal actions, except for movement.

Slow/Stunned overlaps with Quickened.

## Examples
### Quickened Fighter uses movement
Surge uses his Haste ability to Quicken Dame Gloria.

At the start of the next phase, Gloria has 3 actions + Bonus Action.

She spends 3 actions moving. The bonus action is consumed as part of the movement, so Gloria has 1 normal action remaining.

She Raises her Shield and ends her turn.

### Quickened Wizard is inconvenienced
Vale is Slowed 1 and Quickened. At the start of her next phase, she has 2 actions + 1 bonus action

1. She gets 3 actions.
2. Slowed removes 1 of her 3 actions, leaving her with two.
3. Quickened gives her a bonus action.

She cannot cast her 3 action spell to Summon a Storm Elemental, because she cannot combine her 2 actions with the bonus action.

Annoyed, Vale moves (spending the bonus action) and then casts Lightning Bolt (2 actions) to fry her foes.
