# Level
Squaddies gain a level after every successful mission.

They have to survive to gain the level (easier difficulties may waive this restriction.)

Squaddies can spend bonus experience to level up.
The amount needed increases with their Base Value.
This encourages low level squaddies to catch up, as they can make better use.

## Tier
Each Tier represents a level of growth. Each "class" is contained in a tier.
As you gain a Tier, you get a +1 bonus to all of your major abilities.
- Attacks
- Defenses
- Hit Points

## Leader
