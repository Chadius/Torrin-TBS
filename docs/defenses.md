# Defenses
How to resist attacks and mitigate damage.

Reducing health to 0 is the way to stop enemies who are blocking you goals.

But the player doesn't want to reduce their health to 0, either. Defenses help control chokepoints, ignore traps, and stand up to the boss while teammates rally.

In general, Defenses are weaker than Attacks. This avoids stalemates and forces the player to actively protect themselves rather than mindlessly attack.

## Armor and the 3 attributes
Everyone has strengths and resistances, and here we boil it down to 3 principle attributes.

It's important to explain WHY an attack missed/failed.

### Armor
This indicates how easy it is to hit you. A miss may mean it was dodged, or deflected.

- The blade glances off of your full plate armor.
- You quickly step out of the way and the arrow whizzes past.
- You raise a shield to deflect the blow.

### Body
Physical might, agility and health.

A high Body means you can force your way through restraints, slip under cracks and resist diseases.

### Mind
Esoteric Knowledge and Sharp perception and intuition. 

With a strong mind you can quickly analyze and deconstruct complex contraptions.
You can see flaws in magical conjurations and quickly dispel them before they cause long term harm.

### Soul
Intuition, lucky, and beliefs.

A strong soul can exert their will upon the world. Disbelieve curses uttered by dark gods. Steel your mind against mental intrusion.

## Temporary Health
Some activities can give you extra Health, but only until the start of your next turn.
Any damage you take affects your temporary Health first.
This effectively serves as an indicator of "Invulnerability"

## Regeneration
If you can't avoid the damage, heal it off.
This effect restores a small amount of health at the start of each round.

This is potent for players, if they can wait long enough to heal. It's important to force players to keep moving. You want the regenerating to either guard the rear, or to use regen as a supplement.

For enemies, it's only useful against crowds, where some can recover while a few are picked off. Bosses can't take much advantage, as the player will focus fire immediately. 

## Resistance and Weakness
If you're going to get hit, then ignore the damage.

Some creatures can reduce the damage they take from attacks based on the type of damage:
Armor, Body, Mind, Soul. Damage can be reduced to 0, since I expect Health to be low and discrete. Weaknesses deal extra damage. 

Example: A fireball (Mind attack) hits for 3 damage.
- A bandit takes 3 damage from the attack.
- A fire adept has Mind resistance 1 and takes 2 damage from the fireball.
- A Giant Flytrap has 1 Mind weakness and takes 4 damage.

## Healing
When worse comes to worst, spending time to recover is often the best move.
Healing restores lost Health, up to the maximum.

In battle, this needs to be restricted.
- Healing spells should be relatively expensive in terms of energy and actions.
- Healing items should cost 2 actions (1 to retrieve the item, another to consume it.) You also have to purchase or find the supply and give it to someone.

## Defensive Activities
In battle there are actions you can take.

### Active Activities
These activities cost 1 or more actions, but they temporarily improve defense or mitigate damage somehow.

If an attack missed/failed because of these activities, it should be indicated.

For example, Raise a Shield.
- Once per round
- Spend 1 action

Increase your defense against Armor-targeting attacks (more likely to deflect.)
Also gain 1 Temp HP to absorb damage against a blow.

Examples include:
- Raise Shield (Once per round, 1 action, 1 Temp HP, bonus vs Armor attacks)
- Brace Impact (Once per round, 1 action, 1 Temp HP, bonus vs Body attacks)
- Elemental Barrier (Once per round, 1 action, 1 Temp HP, bonus vs Mind attacks)
- Steel Will (Once per round, 1 action, 1 Temp HP, bonus vs Soul attacks)

### Defensive Stances
An activity that costs you 1 action to start it. After that it is free at the start of every turn as long as it was on during the last turn.
It turns off if:
- you choose to end the stance (this is a free action)
- you are stunned
- you choose another stance 
- or you cannot afford the energy cost

Because these stances are relative passive, they tend to be less powerful than activities that require constant upkeep.

For example, Nimble Dodge.
- Stance costs 1 action to activate. Must have 1 energy to start, but it is not spent.
- Costs 1 energy at the start of each round
- Bonus to Armor and Body attacks.

The energy cost forces the player to decide between a stance or saving up for more powerful spells.

Examples include:
- Nimble Dodge (Bonus to Armor and Body attacks)
- Elemental Aura (All Mind attacks within range deal extra damage)
- Sniper Calibration (Penalty to attacks, but more range)
- Calming Aura (Nearby friendly allies get bonus to Soul defense)
