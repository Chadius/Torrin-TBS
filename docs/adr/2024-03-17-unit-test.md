# Unit Testing Strategies
- Failing Tests first
- Then code enough to get the test passing
- Then refactor code with test coverage

Test Driven Development works well at the unit test level. There are a few difficulties I've come across, and 
workarounds for them.

## Challenge: Classes take a while to test
- Many functions need to be mocked out, like drawing
- State is very large and not intuitive, leading to over-implementation
- Just starting the test suite takes a while
- Needs to state user actions to set up scenario rather than setting up the state

Classes take a while to set up. This is a smell there is too much baggage. I would expect this performance
for integrated or journey tests, but unit tests need to be faster.

## Mitigation: Use State objects and Stateless services
Convert classes into a service, which accepts a state object as an argument.
- State under test is more explicit
- State can usually be statically declared without calling too many sub objects
- Fewer items to mock, just the parts that the service calls
