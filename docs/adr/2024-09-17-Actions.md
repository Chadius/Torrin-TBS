# How to generate actions
This is a followup to [2024-05-09-Battle-Actions.md](2024-05-09-Battle-Actions.md) and how and when to make them.

## Battle Action Queue
These represent Battle Actions that have been created and are ready to animate.

No input is required, so don't listen for it.

We have a battle action already active

## Animating
The queue needs everything

Action name
Actor buffs & debuffs
Target buffs & debuffs
Action results
What squaddie
Where is the squaddie moving
Does this end the squaddie's turn?

## After Animating
### Record Event
Record the event and the changes that happened

### Pop event off queue
We're done animating this, pop it off.

### Look for the next event
As long as there are events in the queue animate the next one

# Waiting for next action
We need more completed actions - whose turn is it?

## Computer Action
Computer can make the needed steps to create.

## Player Action
Player makes multiple decisions that turn into Readied Actions.

We block until the player makes enough decisions to make a completed action.

### Select Actor
This is usually a squaddie, there may be special purpose actions in the future (example: Rallying a crowd)

### End Turn
No other decisions needed. Squaddie instantly ends their turn.
This may trigger buff/debuff/end of turn actions.
