# Moving into files
Hardcoded configuration settings and characters are moved into files.

## Advantages
### Separate design from engine
Changing the design requires the system to bundle resources, rebuild code and restart the application.
I want to skip rebuilding the code and just restart the application once the file is bundled.

### Easier to Mod
A fan could create a new map by swapping out maps, characters and abilities, extending the life of the game beyond
what I could do.

## Risks
### Easier to Mod
- It would be easy to cheat by giving all of your players maximum stats.

I accept this risk as this game shouldn't be used for anything official. I also have no enforcement mechanism in place.

- Players could also take over the game by adding their own game and making it more accepted.

If players are having so much fun I kick off a new game engine I'd be honored. Hopefully they are more receptive to my
stories later on. 

### Requires internet connection
While testing offline, the game on itch.io stalls when it tries to fetch a resource. My guess is itch.io keeps the 
resources on their servers and only uploads when requested.

That's the platform's prerogative. I could always offer an offline solution and let people run it in their browsers.

Steam doesn't run online, so it would give people the executable and all the information.
