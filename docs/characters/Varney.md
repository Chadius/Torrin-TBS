# Who is Varney?
Varney Willahd is Sir Camil's cousin. Both were dispatched by their family to join the Crusade, out of embarassment.
While Sir Camil's unwavering dedication made him incorruptible and unable to be influenced, Varney's lust was too excessive to hide.

Varney has always been a gambler, willing to spend family wealth and company profits for on dice, wine, and women. Upper society found him too difficult to hide, as he never hid his abuses or his position.

Sir Camil asked permission to go to the Crusade and drive off the remnants of the demon army that plagued the Western Kingdom. The Willahd elders sought an opportunity to get rid of troublesome family members. Varney joined him to the warfront. He resented Sir Camil's speeches about restraint, control and respect. Who cares about the poors. Sir Camil stuck with him, and Varney looked for any opportunity to escape.

The only thing Varney liked about Nahla was Sir Camil's friendship. He told Sir Camil they worked better as a team, and his role wasn't needed. Nahla's naivety made her exploitable, and Sir Camil was fiercely defensive. She was used for her power over water, not because they needed another mouth to feed.

He heard the whispers in his sleep. A beautiful demon, offering power, riches and pleasure. He would lead patrols out to her hideout and sacrifice the rookies who followed him. The demon slowly brainwashed them, feeding her all the information on the encampment. She told Varney to keep an eye on Nahla, she was unpredictable.

Early on, Nahla told the rest of her team about how she figured out how to bless water to ward off demons. Varney overheard this and told his demon collaborator. She told him to spring a trap, Nahla needs to die before she figures it out.
