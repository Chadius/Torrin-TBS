# Hit Points
Damage is removed from Hit Points. At 0 HIt Points, the squaddie is defeated and is removed. There are a few guidelines to get more Hit Points:
- Characters start with a base number (starting with 3)
- Automatically gain a heart based on starting value (starting with 1 every 6 levels)
- Some long term abilities offer an extra heart when you level up
