# What is a class?
Each playable character chooses a specific class to focus on. This denotes their main role in combat.

- Teros, for example, is a wizard. His primary task is to cast magical spells.
- Torrin is an elementalist. She can conjure effects that revolve around water, like hydraulic blasts and healing wounds.

The class denotes their main role, but as squaddies level up they can veer into different classes.

## Class tiers
Each class ability has a tier. This indicates how advanced a class ability is, and requires you to have a higher class level to use it.

- Tier 0. Automatically given for accessing the class. Often has a focus. Subclassing will get most of these abilities.
- Tier 1. Starter abilities. Usually the main class will have to choose these.
- Tier 2. More expert level abilities, require a Tier 1 ability to be learned.

# Subclassing
As Squaddies level up, they can choose to get more options in their main class, or dabble in a subclass.
It is important to add more options, rather than growing directly in power.

## Subclass restrictions
- The Squaddie must take a minimum number of levels. (Very low)
- After choosing a subclass, the squaddie cannot choose another subclass.
- The subclass introduction must be chosen first and is effectively a tier 0.
- Some abilities cannot be acquired, even in a subclass.
