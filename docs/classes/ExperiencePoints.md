# Experience Points and Leveling Up

## Format
'Level.Experience'

For example 10.2 means level 10, 2 XP.

## How much to level up?
3 xp per level.

So 10.2 is 1 xp away from level 11

## Training Points: Mid level support
Give low level squaddies a chance to catch up.

After each mission, provide Training Points that squaddies can use to level up.

The cost depends on the Squaddie's level. The higher the squaddie's level, the more Training Points are required.

The cost can be adjusted based on the story arc. The later the arc adjusts the curves. 

### Training Points
- represent free time between missions
- faster missions mean more training time so more points
- optional objectives give more training points
- equipment could be tied to training?
