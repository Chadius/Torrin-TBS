# Attacks
The most common type of activity in the game, reducing health to 0 is the best way to eliminate enemies and the ultimate thing to avoid for players and their allies.

From whacking people with a sword to shooting lightning bolts, there are many ways to edit and alter this key activity.

## Naming scheme
- Most attacks names are named after the weapon ("longsword", "scimitar", "spear".)
- Melee Techniques have the words "blow" or "strike" in them ("Tripping strike", "Intimidating blow")
- Ranged techniques will have the words "shot" or "aim" ("Sniper aim", "Multishot")
- Reaction techniques will mention "trap" or "opportunity" ("Trip trap", "Backstab opportunity")

## Attribute Targets
Attacks tend to aim at either your armor or the 3 attributes. 

### Armor
This indicates how easy it is to hit you.

- Your legendary fencing technique catches their arm.
- It's Elementary, my friend. The gap in their armor is... here!
- The spell ignores the armor and surges into your target.

### Body
Physical might, agility and health.

With a high body you can
- hold people down
- smash through weak barriers
- quickly take careful aim
- spit up potent, bile acid

### Mind
Esoteric Knowledge and Sharp perception and intuition.

With a strong mind you can
- Conjure balls of flame
- Build complicated traps to ensnare your foes
- Analyze enemy weaknesses and use magic over physical effect.

### Soul
Intuition, lucky, and beliefs.

A strong soul can:
- Bless your allies with the power of the gods
- Terrify your enemies with a stare
- Alter fate to trigger an attack reroll

### Resistances and Weaknesses
Some targets can resist attacks based on the damage source.

When facing a heavily resistant enemy there are ways to bypass them. 
- Some attacks can combine damage to bypass resistance.
- Some attacks can force minimum damage if they hit.

Weaknesses deal extra damage when hit, so attackers can exploit them.
- Some attacks can force a weakness in their type for 1 round as a potent debuff.

## How many actions?
A basic attack should take 1 action. The player can choose between how many attacks they want to do in a single turn.

There are more complicated maneuvers that will require multiple actions to complete but offer more benefits, like
- extra damage
- range/reach
- debuffs and controls
- multiple targets

These represent an opportunity cost. Perform a quick basic attack for more flexible actions, or perform something fancy and limit your turn?

### 0 actions
Some activities are meant to supplement attacks and do not deal damage on their own.

Examples
- Arcane Imbuement (Followup to casting a spell. Next strike deals bonus damage based on the spell's level.)
- Lucky Reroll (Followup to critically missing an attack. Passively force a reroll.)

### 1 action
These cover basic attacks. They usually just deal damage, although some can deal critical debuffs and controls in special circumstances.

Some attacks cost 1 action but can only be performed once per round, or only as a followup to a previous action.
- Trip (0 damage, causes debuff and soft control)
- Grabbing strike (upon hit, puts enemy off guard)
- Corrected Strike (Must be a Followup, no damage penalty on next attack)
- Skirmish strike (Must be a Followup, attack the target and get a free move action)
- Frightening blow (Attack target. Get a free scare attempt)
- Pummelling Blow (Attack twice ignoring MAP, damage is combined to bypass resistance, only once per round)

Some attacks are minor spells that cost 1 action to activate. These spells don't do much by themselves, so they are part of a setup to be combined with another spell or attack.
- Fated Strike (Roll twice and take the higher roll for the next attack made this round)

### 2 actions
These attacks usually come with a side effect, or pool multiple attacks together.

Examples
- Multishot (Fires 2 times with an attack penalty against 1 target. Damage is combined to bypass resistance.)
- Sweeping strike (Attacks 2 different targets, 2nd attack ignores MAP but does contribute)
- Tripping strike (Attack target and get a Trip attempt that ignores MAP)
- Stupefying blow (Attack target once. Target is stupefied if it is hit and fails to save.)
- Tumbling strike (Try to roll through enemy space. If successful, use free attack against Off-guard target.)

### 3 actions
Spending your entire round to attack means the attack is very powerful, as this is important.

Examples
- Whirlwind strike (attack every target in range without MAP. Must attack different targets.)
- Multishot (Fire 3 times with a penalty against 1 target without MAP. Damage is combined before resistance.)

### On reaction
Some attacks can only be designated on reaction. Because there can be an unlimited number of reactions taken, these are individually less powerful than a base attack.

Examples
- Opportunity Strike (If any unfriendlies move through your basic strike range, you get to attack them once with a penalty.)
- Hunted Opportunity (Target one squaddie. If they move or cast while in your range, attack.)
- Snare trap (Target a space. If any unfriendlies move into that space, you react and can slow them down if they fail their body save.)
- Counterstrike Opportunity (If an unfriendly attack critically misses, you get a free basic attack.)

## MAB/MAP: Multiple Attack Bonus/Penalty
Stealing this from Pathfinder 2e.

With 3 actions per turn, we need to make sure players do something besides attack 3 times.

Adding a cumulative penalty on attacks made this round can make the opportunity cost more clear.
- Attacking once should almost always be worth it.
- Attacking twice is a good bet.
- Attacking more than twice should be discouraged, so players will think tactically.

"What will I do with my last action?" Should be a common question for players.

- First attack can be done with the listed number (0 bonus/penalty)
- Second attack can take a small penalty (-1 penalty)
- More attacks can take a larger penalty (-2, -4, etc)

We could use the good old "flip the penalty" strategy to make it seem like a bonus.
- First attack gets a +2 bonus to attack
- Second attack gets a +1 bonus
- More attacks get no bonus

It feels less of a penalty, but maybe players won't notice the hat trick. Could always make the second attack neutral.
- First attack gets a +1 bonus.
- Second attack has no bonus/penalty.
- More than 2 attacks take a -1 penalty.

There are attacks that ignore MAP, like most reaction attacks. Spending your first action with them is usually a good idea.

There are attacks that ignore MAP but also count towards your MAP. So you can attack twice at full bonus, for example. But your 3rd attack would suffer the biggest penalty.
