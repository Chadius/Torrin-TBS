## Gameplay features
### Key Skills
#### Easy to Learn
##### Hex Map movement
You can move left, right, and diagonally up left, up right, down left, down right.

This means you can surround someone in 6 directions. This leads to fewer bottlenecks but maps are not in 4 directions.
##### Easy Undo
The player can undo any actions made during their phase of combat.

Random rolls are fixed.

##### 3 action turns
Each turn you get 3 actions. If you want to move 3 times, go for it. If you want to attack 3 times, attack (but beware of the accumulative penalty.)

Some activities cost multiple actions, like spells.

Reactions can be set up in advance or weaker unlimited versions.

##### Choose your favorite teammates
10 teammates (with a forced leader) lets you choose your strategy.

#### Hard to Master
##### Use your third action effectively
Attack penalties should be so bad on the third attack that it's inefficient to make the attack.
Experts will spend time to prepare, control or debuff their foes.
##### Debuffing enemies to set up finishing blows
Flanking a foe reduces their defenses, making it easier to hit.
Blinding a foe gives a chance to miss attacks.

The idea is to prepare powerful attacks. You don't want it to miss, so to maximize the chance to land you want to ruin their defenses and weaken their resistances.

##### Crowd Control to rob actions
Controller powers can force opponents to waste actions moving into position, or forcing extra misses on their foes.
A stun effect, for example, will make an enemy lose an action.
A trip effect causes someone to stand up. This could provoke an attack of opportunity.
Enticing a minion to approach, weakening a chokepoint.

##### Team composition and synergy
Combining the right team and abilities allow the player to exceed mathematical ranges and defeat foes.
- Tank takes point to lure enemies while the Striker picks off the greatest threats.
- Buffer keeps a Striker alive and the Controller keeps enemies away.
- Intel discovers a hidden path to bypass the enemy stronghold and gather treasure.

Success will involve people arguing over the "best" team for each situation.

##### Resource management
A supply on consumable items restore after every mission. You can improve the stock by stealing or finding treasure during missions.
Extra challenges can be used to unlock rare abilities, giving unique advantages.
Maybe they can learn abilities learned by other characters.

### Magical Desert Fantasy
Setting takes place in a desert. Sand, stone temples, water oases and wind swept towns.

### Squad Focus
Parties of 4 who use teamwork to get the job done.

- Strikers need protection so they can spend their time eliminating foes.
- Buffers need protection so they can neutralize enemies.
- Tanks need others to deal damage while they stall for time.
- Controllers can slow and distract the enemy, but someone needs to deal damage.
- Intel can spend time to figure out how to deliver key intelligence.

### 2D Web App
2D hexagonal grid that can run off of your web browser.

# Inspiration
Many places to take inspiration from.

## Games
### Fire Emblem (Game Boy Advance, 2003)
Turn-Based Strategy game with a heavy emphasis on story. Story's full of plot holes but the spectacle is so strong you don't notice.

### X-COM 2 (2017?)
Turn-Based Strategy with an emphasis on small squads against an alien invasion.

Squads promote from the introductory class to one of four classes.

Injured squadmates have to sit out subsequent missions or risk permanent death.

Chance of long-term campaign failure is very high, and you're meant to restart.

## Mood Board
A few quick ideas, see the Trello board.
### Magical Desert Fantasy
A sophisticated magical city, within a magically infused desert.
### Young Water Elemental Priestess
Torrin, a young djinn made of water, becomes a priestess of good and joins an army to fight an evil army.
### Crusader of Justice
Sir Camil hails from the Western Kingdom, where he learned the tenets of justice and practices them to this day.

He teams up with Torrin and encourages her to practice herself. 
### Fire Emblem (Game Boy Advance, 2003)
The Desert kingdom of Nabata kept a peace between dragons and humans while the rest of the continent of Elibe waged war.

Presentation uses busts of up to 4 characters with limited conversation (2 lines of 25 characters.)

# Tone and Pitch

## Theatrical, not Cinematic
In a stage play, you can embrace more absurdist tendencies.
- Characters are willing to wink at the audience, or turn to them to express their current emotion
- Tone can sometimes shift. A haunted train could have a delightful restaurant where someone remarks on the absurdity
- The audience is taken on an entertaining trip, rather than witnessing an epic tale

## Abstracted, not Realistic
Due to constraints, I can't chance photo realism.
For the art style I want more animation and keeping it loose.
I'm not a fan of realism anyway.

- Portraits to represent characters rather than elaborate 3D models
- Art focuses on expression, not on accuracy

## Community over Loneliness
A sense of belonging. Finding your tribe. Teammates come from different origins and philosophies, but together they find a Home.
- Lone Wolf mentality always backfires, no second opinion leads to risk and personal errors.
- Rejecting help leads to unneeded stress.
- Helping other people builds karma.

## Similar works?
### Fire Emblem 2003 (Game Boy Advance)
This game and the previous game showcase the desert oasis, Nabata. 
Humans and Dragons coexist, ignoring the war between the two creatures that rage outside.
One of the Great Human Heroes came to Nabata and raised a great sandstorm to protect them from outside invaders.

Another wizard came and befriended the hero. Both studied magical arts, became fast friends and great residents of Nabata. 
Even the wizard found love.

But when someone kidnapped his wife and children, the wizard tapped into ancient, uncontrollable magic to fight the kidnappers.
He won at the cost of his soul. He was no more than a vessel to evil, and used the souls of the fallen to create facsimiles of humans.
His goal: use his children to break the barrier between Elibe and the Dragon Realm, and let the Dragons raze the world.

- Setting takes place in a magical realm between humans and fantastic creatures

### The Daevabad Trilogy
City of Brass
Kingdom of Copper
Empire of Gold

S.A. Chakraborty. 2017

(I only read the last 2 books)

Nahri is a quick witten con artist who discovers she has links to the magical kingdom of Daevabad. Her song calls an efreet
who whisks her off her feet, brings her to a nation full of djinn, and helps her discover her watery marid roots.
She can heal, she can manipulate the lake. She's also disruptive to the status quo, and she forms an odd friendship with the prince.

Her mother, her real mother, is still alive. The marids once ruled Daevabad through religious zealotry and were slaughtered by the current ruler's ancestors.
Her mother's grief and revenge boil into a plot to kill the leaders and take over, even if she has to turn blind to her efreet sponsors
who prod her into one atrocity after another.

Nahri realizes she could just go home. But abandoning her heritage is like tearing off part of her identity. So she braves danger,
forges uneasy alliances, and thinks quickly to save herself and her second home.

- Water aligned main character
- Underestimated mundane life
- Sins of the ancestors lead to more pain down the road


### Castlevania: Symphony of the Night
Konami, 1997. (Sony Playstation 1 and Sega Saturn)

The lord of vampires, the prince of darkness: Dracula himself! Fell in love with a human named Lisa. They bore a son named Alucard.
For a moment, the vampire lord felt at peace. But when Lisa was burned at the stake for being a witch he renewed his war against 
humanity. Alucard fought alongside the vampire hunting clan, the Belmonts, to defeat his father. Then he went to sleep, to bury his cursed timeline.

A few centuries later he awoke from his slumber, drawn to Castlevania. He soon learned that the current Belmont, Richter, had gone mad.
He raised the castle in an effort to raise Dracula. He beat him once five years ago, and wanted the thrill of battle again- even
if the evils of the world would rise again and claim the land. Alucard eventually earned the trust of Richter's friend Maria
and learned of a sinister plot.

Alucard reached the castle summit and saw through the illusion - the dark wizard Shaft had mind controlled Richter and played him
as a puppet, perverting his holy powers to raise the castle and summon the dark lord. Alucard traveled through an inverted castle
to kill the wizard and fight his father once again, reminding him of the love he once felt. Dracula retreated, thanking his son
and destroying the castle.
