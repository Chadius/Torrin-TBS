# Inspiration
Many places to take inspiration from.

## Games
### Fire Emblem (Game Boy Advance, 2003)
Turn-Based Strategy game with a heavy emphasis on story. Story's full of plot holes but the spectacle is so strong you don't notice.

### X-COM 2 (2017?)
Turn-Based Strategy with an emphasis on small squads against an alien invasion.

Squads promote from the introductory class to one of four classes.

Injured squadmates have to sit out subsequent missions or risk permanent death.

Chance of long-term campaign failure is very high, and you're meant to restart.
