## Gameplay features
### Key Skills
#### Easy to Learn
##### Hex Map movement
You can move left, right, and diagonally up left, up right, down left, down right.

This means you can surround someone in 6 directions. This leads to fewer bottlenecks but maps are not in 4 directions.
##### Easy Undo
The player can undo any actions made during their phase of combat.

Random rolls are fixed.

##### 3 action turns
Each turn you get 3 actions. If you want to move 3 times, go for it. If you want to attack 3 times, attack (but beware of the accumulative penalty.)

Some activities cost multiple actions, like spells.

Reactions can be set up in advance or weaker unlimited versions.

##### Choose your favorite teammates
10 teammates (with a forced leader) lets you choose your strategy.

#### Hard to Master
##### Use your third action effectively
Attack penalties should be so bad on the third attack that it's inefficient to make the attack.
Experts will spend time to prepare, control or debuff their foes.
##### Debuffing enemies to set up finishing blows
Flanking a foe reduces their defenses, making it easier to hit.
Blinding a foe gives a chance to miss attacks.

The idea is to prepare powerful attacks. You don't want it to miss, so to maximize the chance to land you want to ruin their defenses and weaken their resistances.

##### Crowd Control to rob actions
Controller powers can force opponents to waste actions moving into position, or forcing extra misses on their foes.
A stun effect, for example, will make an enemy lose an action.
A trip effect causes someone to stand up. This could provoke an attack of opportunity.
Enticing a minion to approach, weakening a chokepoint.

##### Team composition and synergy
Combining the right team and abilities allow the player to exceed mathematical ranges and defeat foes.
- Tank takes point to lure enemies while the Striker picks off the greatest threats.
- Buffer keeps a Striker alive and the Controller keeps enemies away.
- Intel discovers a hidden path to bypass the enemy stronghold and gather treasure.

Success will involve people arguing over the "best" team for each situation.

##### Resource management
A supply on consumable items restore after every mission. You can improve the stock by stealing or finding treasure during missions.
Extra challenges can be used to unlock rare abilities, giving unique advantages.
Maybe they can learn abilities learned by other characters.

### Magical Desert Fantasy
Setting takes place in a desert. Sand, stone temples, water oases and wind swept towns.

### Squad Focus
Parties of 4 who use teamwork to get the job done.

- Strikers need protection so they can spend their time eliminating foes.
- Buffers need protection so they can neutralize enemies.
- Tanks need others to deal damage while they stall for time.
- Controllers can slow and distract the enemy, but someone needs to deal damage.
- Intel can spend time to figure out how to deliver key intelligence.

### 2D Web App

# Inspiration
Many places to take inspiration from.

## Games
### Fire Emblem (Game Boy Advance, 2003)
Turn-Based Strategy game with a heavy emphasis on story. Story's full of plot holes but the spectacle is so strong you don't notice.

### X-COM 2 (2017?)
Turn-Based Strategy with an emphasis on small squads against an alien invasion.

Squads promote from the introductory class to one of four classes.

Injured squadmates have to sit out subsequent missions or risk permanent death.

Chance of long-term campaign failure is very high, and you're meant to restart.

## Mood Board
A few quick ideas, see the Trello board.
### Magical Desert Fantasy
A sophisticated magical city, within a magically infused desert.
### Young Water Elemental Priestess
Torrin, a young djinn made of water, becomes a priestess of good and joins an army to fight an evil army.
### Crusader of Justice

He teams up with Torrin and encourages her to practice herself. 
### Fire Emblem (Game Boy Advance, 2003)
